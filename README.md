### Questions
1. What are BID_TYP, STATUS_ID, SELECTION_NAME, PERSISTENCE_TYPE and INPLAY_BET.

### Thoughts
1. If time & dates (holiday, weekday) have impacts on people's behaviour (e.g. Bet_size)
2. If players behaviour different between different countries, event_type?
3. If players can be segmented based on their transactions history including (frequency, size, recency, favorates to particular events?) and in turn, target the most valuable segments to BetFair.
